The target of this conflict is the establishment of a sovereign and independent Palestinian state alongside Israel, with mutually agreed-upon borders. However, achieving this goal has proven to be challenging due to various factors such as territorial disputes, security concerns, and the complex nature of the conflict. </p><h2>Personal Experience and Deeper Explanation</h2><p> As a traveler who has visited both Israel and Palestine, I have witnessed firsthand the impact of the conflict on the daily lives of people living in the region.
