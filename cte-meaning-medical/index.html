It is often associated with repeated blows to the head, such as those experienced by athletes in contact sports like football and boxing. CTE can have serious implications for the individuals affected, including cognitive and behavioral changes that can impact their quality of life. </p><p> So, what exactly does CTE mean in the medical field? CTE is a neurodegenerative disease characterized by the buildup of abnormal proteins in the brain, which can lead to the destruction of brain cells over time. This buildup is believed to be caused by repeated head trauma, which triggers a cascade of events that ultimately result in the development of CTE. </p><p> In summary, CTE meaning medical refers to a condition characterized by the buildup of abnormal proteins in the brain due to repeated head trauma.
