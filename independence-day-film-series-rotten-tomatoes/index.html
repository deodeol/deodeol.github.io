Both films in the series have received mixed reviews from critics, with the original film holding a 65% approval rating on Rotten Tomatoes and the sequel receiving a 30% approval rating. </p><p> The Independence Day film series has become known for its epic action sequences, stunning visual effects, and memorable one-liners.
