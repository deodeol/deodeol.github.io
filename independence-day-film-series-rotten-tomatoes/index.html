Both films in the series have received mixed reviews from critics, with the original film holding a 65% approval rating on Rotten Tomatoes and the sequel receiving a 30% approval rating. </p><p> The Independence Day film series has become known for its epic action sequences, stunning visual effects, and memorable one-liners.

The film was a massive success, grossing over $800 million worldwide and becoming the highest-grossing film of that year. It also received positive reviews from critics, who praised its thrilling action and impressive visual effects. </p><p> The success of the original film led to the release of a sequel, Independence Day: Resurgence, in 2016.

While the sequel did not perform as well at the box office as its predecessor, it still managed to bring in over $389 million worldwide.
