The thirteen American colonies, which were under British rule at the time, sought to gain their independence and establish a new nation.

In fact, the conflict had far-reaching international implications. European powers such as France, Spain, and the Netherlands provided support to the American colonies in their fight against the British. German soldiers, as mentioned earlier, also played a significant role in the war.
